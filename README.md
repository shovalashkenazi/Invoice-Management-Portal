# üìä Nimble - Invoice managment Portal

A fullstack application for managing and analyzing invoice data with interactive visualizations, CSV upload functionality, and real-time filtering capabilities.

## üß© Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React** with TypeScript
- **Chakra UI** for component library and styling
- **Recharts** for data visualizations
- **React Router** for navigation

### Backend

- **NestJS** with TypeScript
- **Prisma ORM** for database operations
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage

## üöÄ Features

### Business Logic

> \_An invoice is considered **overdue** if its `invoice_due_date` has passed and its `invoice_status` is still PENDING.

- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregates invoice data efficiently by status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled, pending), billing month, and customer.
- **CSV Upload**: Supports uploading and parsing CSV files, with validation and normalization. Parsed records are stored in a relational database using Prisma, ensuring data consistency and referential integrity.
- **Filtering**: Enables advanced filtering of invoice records based on date range, invoice status, and customer identity.
